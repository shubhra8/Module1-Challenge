## Overview

Refactoring an existing site to make it more accessible.
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.

### Refactored Code

Used semantic HTML elements.
Elements followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
Alt attribute used in icon and image elements.
Heading attributes are in sequential order and descriptive title is used for the website.
Comments are given in index.html and CSS files where modification are done.
